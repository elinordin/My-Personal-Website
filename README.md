# Personal Website
---
Hyper Island - The Fundamentals module - Brief 1.


### :scroll: Brief:
Build a text-based personal website. Side-quest was to 1) include an image, background pattern, video or sound and 2) add a subpage linked from the main page and vice versa.


### :hourglass: Time spent:
2 weeks.


### :checkered_flag: Goals:
To get the fundamental understanding and comfortability of writing HTML and CSS and challange myself to practice JavaScript on my own in preparation for the upcoming brief. My focus was to really understand the display and position properties.


### :heavy_check_mark: Solution:
I played around with many different things like animations, prototyping, fonts and basic JavaScript. It was a good first brief to get into the process of how to structure a project.


### :closed_book: Learnings:

* If(stuck){takeBreak()}
* Use let or const instead of var
* Write down your learnings to realize you are making progress
* Make a list of must-haves and nice-to-haves to keep you focusing on the right things
* To explain something to someone else is a great way of putting something in words and to simplify it to yourself

### :computer: Tech used in this specific repository:
* HTML
