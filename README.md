My Personal Website

Out first brief was to create a personal website using HTML and CSS. My goal was to really understand the position and display properties, which made me not use grid or flexbox for this brief. I included som very basic JavaScript to practice and to get ready for our next module and played around a with responsiveness, colors, fonts and animations.
